/**
 * The buildings of CamboVerse.
 *
 * A **building** is a place a visitor can walk up to and then open a page of
 * its own — its architecture, what happens inside, and why it looks the way it
 * does. A **site** is a group of buildings you can walk between: a campus, a
 * commune centre, a market square.
 *
 * Both are listed on the 🏛 Buildings page (`BuildingsHome`), which is the only
 * way in. The map carries one button, not one per building — the front page is
 * a map of Cambodia, not a directory.
 *
 * A building may belong to a site or stand alone. A standalone building has no
 * walkable scene; it just gets its page. Either way, adding one is an entry
 * here — see `docs/BUILDINGS.md`.
